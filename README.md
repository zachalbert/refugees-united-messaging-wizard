Refugees United Message Wizard Prototype
===============

This prototype attempts to address the following challenges with the current messaging system:
* USSD has a 2 minute timeout
* Refugees may or may not be illiterate, and are very likely technically illiterate
* Input method is most likely basic 10-key input (typing the word "hello" requires typing 4,4,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6)

This is a dumb prototype, meant to step through a single use case to demonstrate the idea for the Global Hack for Good with Refugees United and Ericsson.

To run:
1. Clone the repo
2. Open index.html in a browser
3. Enter any information in the input field, which will step through the sequence of screens
